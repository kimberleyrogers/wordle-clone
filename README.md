## 🔠 ABOUT

In early 2022 [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle) was played millions of times a day all around the world. The only catch - you can play once a day. I created my own version to practice new skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript and to play for as loooonnng as I like.

## 🏉 PLAY

## 📚 HOW TO PLAY

Just like traditional Wordle, attempt to guess a random five letter word in six tries or less.
Type a valid five letter word into the input field, press enter and your word appears in a row.
Green letters represent a perfect position match between your guess and the Wordle.
Yellow letters tell you the letter is in the Wordle, but in another position.
Use these clues to decipher the Wordle within six guesses.
Click 'Another Game?' to play again.

## 🖥 TECHNICAL

Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The project allowed me to solidify the concepts I've been learning, including:

#### ✅ HTML
+ Semantic HTML
+ Tags, IDs, classes
+ Boilerplate
+ Importing Fonts

#### ✅ CSS
+ Flexbox
+ Grid

#### ✅ Javascript
+ Functions
+ Loops
+ Arrays
+ if/else if statements
+ DOM manipulation

I'm most proud of the function I built to ensure that words with repeat letters display with the correct colour (green/yellow/none). This process tested my understanding of Javascript, my patience and required approximately 74,840 console.logs

## 🤖 FUTURE

+ A keyboard - to track which letters you've used
+ Make the 'wordle' title dance on hover or on load
+ Make the error/win/lose message dance on load
+ Light mode button to reverse black and white of the page
+ Hard mode - where user must include the green/yellow letters used in the previous turn
